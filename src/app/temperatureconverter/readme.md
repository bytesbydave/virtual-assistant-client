Question:

You are tasked with creating a Temperature Converter component in a React application. The Temperature Converter should allow users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Your goal is to build a reusable and maintainable Temperature Converter component using React.

Create a React component called TemperatureConverter that includes two input fields: one for Celsius and one for Fahrenheit.
Implement two-way data binding so that when the user enters a value in one input field, the other input field updates automatically with the converted temperature.
Handle temperature conversion logic when the user enters a value in either input field. The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is (Celsius * 9/5) + 32, and the formula to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
Ensure that the component displays appropriate placeholder text and labels for each input field.
Add styling or CSS classes to make the component visually appealing and user-friendly.
Please describe your approach, including the key React concepts and state management techniques you would use to build this Temperature Converter component.

Guidelines for the Interviewer:

Encourage the interviewee to discuss the component structure, state management, and event handling in React.
Look for their ability to implement two-way data binding between the input fields.
Assess their understanding of how to handle conversion logic and update the component's state accordingly.
Evaluate their knowledge of handling user input and displaying it in a controlled manner.
Consider asking them to provide code snippets or pseudocode to illustrate their approach or even implement a portion of the Temperature Converter component.

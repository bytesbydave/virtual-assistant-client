Question:

You are tasked with creating a Progress Bar component in a React application. The Progress Bar should visually display progress based on a given percentage value. Your goal is to build a reusable and maintainable Progress Bar component using React.

Create a React component called ProgressBar that accepts a percentage prop indicating the progress percentage (a number between 0 and 100).
Display the progress visually within the component, showing the percentage complete.
Ensure that the Progress Bar updates whenever the percentage prop changes.
Add styling or CSS classes to make the Progress Bar visually appealing and informative.
Optionally, allow customization through additional props such as color, height, or labels.
Please describe your approach, including the key React concepts and state management techniques you would use to build this Progress Bar component.

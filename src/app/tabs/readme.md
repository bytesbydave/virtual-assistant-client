Question:

You are tasked with creating a Tabs component in a React application. The Tabs component should allow users to switch between different content sections by clicking on tabs. Your goal is to build a reusable and maintainable Tabs component using React.

Create a React component called Tabs that displays a set of tabs and content sections.
Implement the functionality to switch between content sections when a tab is clicked.
Ensure that only one content section is displayed at a time, and it corresponds to the active tab.
Provide customization options to allow the addition of more tabs and content sections.
Optionally, add styling or CSS classes to make the Tabs component visually appealing.
Please describe your approach, including the key React concepts, state management techniques, and event handling you would use to build this Tabs component.

Question:

You are tasked with creating a Job Board component in a React application. The Job Board should display a list of job postings, allowing users to view job details and apply for jobs. Your goal is to build a reusable and maintainable Job Board component using React.

Create a React component called JobBoard that displays a list of job postings.
Fetch job data from an API (simulated or real) and display job listings, including job titles, company names, and application buttons.
Implement a feature that allows users to click on a job posting to view its details.
Add a "Apply Now" button for each job posting, which can be clicked to initiate the application process (simulated).
Ensure that the Job Board component can handle different types of job data, such as remote jobs, full-time jobs, and part-time jobs.
Optionally, allow filtering and sorting of job listings based on criteria like location, job type, or company.
Please describe your approach, including the key React concepts and state management techniques you would use to build this Job Board component.

Guidelines for the Interviewer:

Encourage the interviewee to discuss the component structure, data fetching, rendering, and event handling in React.
Look for their ability to create a component that fetches and displays data from an API.
Assess their understanding of state management and component communication, especially when displaying job details.
Evaluate their knowledge of handling user interactions like applying for a job.
Consider asking them to provide code snippets or pseudocode to illustrate their approach or even implement a portion of the Job Board component, including data fetching and displaying job listings.
